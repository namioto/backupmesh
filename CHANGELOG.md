# Changelog

All notable changes to BackupMesh are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased] - 0.1.1

### Added

- A bilingual Inno Setup wizard that installs the Windows service, tray app, bundled tools, firewall rules, automatic startup, Start menu shortcuts, and uninstaller from one executable.
- A reproducible `build-windows-installer.ps1` entry point with package and version validation.

### Fixed

- Windows package builds now clean their exact artifacts directory before publishing, preventing stale files and nested license directories from leaking into later installers.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-29

First end-to-end MVP release.

### Added

- Linux Source Agent with Backup Set catalog synchronization, Storage command watching, progress reporting, cancellation, and concurrent multi-target restic backups.
- Windows Storage Agent service and tray app with fixed, removable, and folder-backed device registration.
- Many-to-many Source Agent, Backup Set, device, and destination-folder mappings.
- Per-device arrival delay, device notifications, job monitoring, and safe-eject coordination.
- Self-contained Windows and Linux packages with pinned restic 0.19.1 and rest-server 0.14.0 binaries.
- English and Korean README and user guides covering installation, pairing, backup, restoration, and troubleshooting.

### Security

- Identity-bound Source pairing with a private CA, mutual TLS, pinned Storage certificates, and independent bearer credentials.
- TLS-protected rest-server transport, encrypted restic repositories, append-only repository access, and protected ephemeral key handling.
- Restricted Windows service-data permissions and owner-only Linux credential files.

### Verified

- Real-file backup to two folder-backed targets followed by restoration from both repositories and SHA-256 content comparison.
- Windows package build, Linux package build and installation under Ubuntu, .NET tests, Go tests and vet, protocol validation, and systemd unit validation.
